#architecture #pattern #web 

Uses the principle [hypermedia](/architecture/techradar/hypermedia.md)

- state storage in resources
- abstraction from concrete locations
- linking / navigation of resources via [links](/)
- clients navigate (as on the Web) from resource to resource
- client only needs to know start [URI](/techstack/network/URI.md), further calls are offered by the server
- advantage
	- client does not need to have any further information about the structure of the application
