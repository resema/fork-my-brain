- [[document-oriented database ]]
	- based e.g. on [[XML]] structures
	- suitable for semi-structured to unstructured data (f.ex. text)
- [[column-oriented database]]
- [[key-value database]]
	- simple key-value data structure
	- advantage: faster
	- disadvantage: less suitable for complex data structures
- [[hierarchical database ]]
	- oldest DB model
	- hierarchical tree structure
- [[object-relational database]]
	- extension of relational DBS with object-oriented structures
- [[object-oriented database]]
	- based on object-oriented structures
