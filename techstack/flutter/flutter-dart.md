[Flutter usefull links](/techstack/flutter/Flutter%20usefull%20links.md) are helpful if some insights are needed

As an introduction I'm watching [Udemy course for Flutter&Dart](/techstack/flutter/Udemy%20course%20for%20Flutter&Dart.md)
Often a [IOS simulator](/techstack/ios/IOS%20simulator.md) is often needed

The basic folder cantains a `.packages` file which is auto-generated while [creating packages in flutter](/techstack/flutter/creating%20packages%20in%20flutter.md) as well as the [pubspec.yaml](/techstack/flutter/pubspec.yaml.md) file for configuring the flutter application.

Consists of both, a [Flutter SDK](/Flutter%20SDK) and a [Flutter Framework](/Flutter%20Framework) in the same time based on [Dart](/techstack/flutter/Dart.md).

Some [Flutter basics](/techstack/flutter/Flutter%20basics.md) are f.ex. in Flutter everything is a [widget](/techstack/flutter/widget.md), which can be used from the SDK or can be customized by [customized widget](/customized%20widget)s.
