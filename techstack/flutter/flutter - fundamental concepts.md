Use f.ex. a web based playground as [DartPad](/https://dartpad.dev)

General information can be found on [Flutter.dev](/https://flutter.dev)

It has some examples for:
- [HTTP](/techstack/network/HTTP.md) request
- [Firebase](/techstack/google/Firebase.md) nanochat

## Basics
- everything in Dart is an object
- [widget](/techstack/flutter/widget.md)s often contain other [widget](/techstack/flutter/widget.md)s
- [naming convention](/techstack/go/naming%20convention.md) for classes is [PascalCase](/PascalCase)
- flutter uses [inheritance](/techstack/flutter/inheritance.md) by using the keywork `extend`
	- dependency in [pubspec.yaml](/techstack/flutter/pubspec.yaml.md) shows the import of [Flutter SDK](/Flutter%20SDK)
- package [material.dart](/techstack/flutter/material.dart.md) imports some of the most basic methods

### Data Types
- lists are generated with `[]`

## Best Practices
- add a comma after every closing parenthesis
- one [widget](/techstack/flutter/widget.md) per file
