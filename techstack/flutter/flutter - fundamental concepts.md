#flutter 

Use f.ex. a web based playground as [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev)

It has some examples for:
- [[HTTP]] request
- [[Firebase]] nanochat

## Basics
- everything in Dart is an object
- [[widget]]s often contain other [[widget]]s
- [[naming convention]] for classes is [[PascalCase]]
- flutter uses [[inheritance]] by using the keywork `extend`
	- dependency in [[pubspec.yaml]] shows the import of [[Flutter SDK]]
- package [[flutter/material.dart]] imports some of the most basic methods

### Data Types
- lists are generated with `[]`

## Best Practices
- add a comma after every closing parenthesis
- one [[widget]] per file
