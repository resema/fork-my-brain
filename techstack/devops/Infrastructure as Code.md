- scripts
- [Terraform](/techstack/devops/Terraform.md)

#### Advantages
- Is often part of [CI](/techstack/devops/Continuous%20Integration.md)/[CD](/techstack/devops/Continuous%20Deployment.md) pipelines
- Build/destroy infrastructure when needed or not in use
- create identical dev, test or prod
- templates are [building block](/building%20block)s for [disaster recovery](/disaster%20recovery) procedures
