One of the ways a user is able to influence the [[HTTP]] response they get back from an HTTP [[server]] is by using the [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string). 

The query string is a set of values added to the end of a [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL). It starts with a `?` character, with additional values added using `&` as a delimiter. 

Query string values are commonly used as a way to filter or customize the results an HTTP server sends as a response. For example, one server may use a `results` value to allow a user to specify something like `results=10` to say they’d like to see 10 items in their list of results.
