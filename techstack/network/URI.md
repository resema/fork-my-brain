### Best practices
- plural nouns for sets (collections)
- singular nouns for individual resources
- strive for consistent naming
- URI is case-insensitive
- don't use verbs to identify a resource
- include verison information

Used in [REST](/techstack/network/REST.md) or  [HTTP](/techstack/network/HTTP.md) protocols between services.

Is a way to the machine. [URL](/techstack/network/URL.md) is a subtime of URI.
- client identifies a resource to the server via a URI with the schema [HTTP](/techstack/network/HTTP.md) or [HTTPS](/techstack/network/HTTPS.md).
