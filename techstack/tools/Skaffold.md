Skaffold is a command-line tool that enables continuous development for [Kubernetes](/Kubernetes)-native applications. You can use Skaffold to configure a local development workspace to use with Google Cloud Deploy continuous delivery pipelines.

Skaffold includes the following features:

-   It gives you discrete control of CI/CD pipeline activities (build, render, test deploy, and so on).
-   It's useful as a local development tool.
-   Skaffold profiles let you differentiate among different environments, with different build, test, and deploy configurations, all in the same configuration file.
