Automates the creation and managment of compute infrastructure
- [cluster](/cluster)s have a collection of [Node](/techstack/gcp/Node.md)s
- [Node](/techstack/gcp/Node.md)s are [compute engine](/compute%20engine) [VM](/VM)s
- [service](/techstack/gcp/service.md)s are deployt into [pod](/techstack/gcp/pod.md)s
- optimize resource utilization by deploying multiple [service](/techstack/gcp/service.md)s to the same [cluster](/cluster)
- you pay for the [VM](/VM)s
