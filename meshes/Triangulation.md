A triangulation is a set of [[triangle]]s in a three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].

Is constructed by
- [[vertice]]s location
- [[triangle]]s sequence (left or right-handed)
- can have [[vertex attribute]]s
- can have [[triangle attribute]]s
- the [[vertex normal]]s can be hold f.ex. as [[vertex attribute]]s
- the [[triangle normal]]s can be hold f.ex. as [[triangle attribute]]s

A triangulation has properties like [[manigfold]] or [[watertight]]. It consists of mulitple or single [[mesh component]]s. See also [[component analysis]].

DS stores them as explained in [[Exchange and Storage of Triangulations]] as [[proto file]]s.
