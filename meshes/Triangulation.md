A triangulation is a set of [triangle](/triangle)s in a three-dimensional [Euclidean space](/Euclidean%20space).

Is constructed by
- [vertice](/vertice)s location
- [triangle](/triangle)s sequence (left or right-handed)
- can have [vertex attribute](/vertex%20attribute)s
- can have [triangle attribute](/triangle%20attribute)s
- the [vertex normal](/vertex%20normal)s can be hold f.ex. as [vertex attribute](/vertex%20attribute)s
- the [triangle normal](/triangle%20normal)s can be hold f.ex. as [triangle attribute](/triangle%20attribute)s

A triangulation has properties like [manigfold](/manigfold) or [watertight](/watertight). It consists of mulitple or single [mesh component](/mesh%20component)s. See also [component analysis](/component%20analysis).

DS stores them as explained in [Exchange and Storage of Triangulations](/Exchange%20and%20Storage%20of%20Triangulations) as [proto file](/proto%20file)s.
